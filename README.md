Hospitality Revenue Analysis – Power BI
📌 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Hospitality Revenue Analysis built using Power BI. The analysis focuses on evaluating hotel performance across key revenue and occupancy metrics to support data-driven decision-making.

The dataset was obtained from an organizational source and transformed using Power Query (ETL). A structured data model was created using fact and dimension tables to enable efficient analysis and reporting.

🎯 Objective

To analyze hotel performance by tracking revenue, occupancy, and operational efficiency using industry-standard hospitality metrics, and to provide actionable insights for revenue optimization and capacity planning.
